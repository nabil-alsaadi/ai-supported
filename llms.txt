# AI Supported

> A transparency signal for creators who use AI as an assistive technology.

## What This Is

AI Supported is a free, open-source badge that allows creators to ethically disclose their use of AI while maintaining human accountability. The badge reads:

**"* ✨ AI Supported - Human Verified"**

It signals that while AI assisted in the creation process, a human reviewed, verified, and takes full responsibility for the final result.

## Who This Is For

This badge exists primarily for accessibility users:

- **Dyslexic creators** who use AI for spelling and grammar support
- **ADHD and neurodivergent individuals** who benefit from AI as a thinking partner
- **Non-native speakers** who use AI to polish their expression
- **Anyone with a disability** that makes traditional writing challenging
- **Ethical creators** who want transparency without apology

## The Problem We're Solving

Many brilliant pieces of work are now dismissed as "AI slop" when they are actually human passion projects enhanced by AI assistance. AI writing detectors create false positives that disproportionately affect:

- Writers with unconventional sentence structures
- Neurodivergent individuals whose natural patterns differ from "expected" writing
- People who use legitimate accessibility tools

This creates discrimination against those who need AI assistance the most. Current AI detection offers only a binary "Human" or "AI" result - leaving no room for the reality of "Human-led, AI-polished" work.

## Our Philosophy

**AI is a tool, not a replacement.**

Using AI for grammar, spelling, or formatting assistance is no different from:
- Using spellcheck
- Using text-to-speech software  
- Using a dictionary or thesaurus
- Having an editor review your work

The ideas, the research, the creative thinking, and the hours of effort are all human. AI simply helps bridge the gap between capability and expression.

**Transparency builds trust.**

By openly acknowledging AI use, creators demonstrate integrity. The "Human Verified" aspect of the badge emphasises that a real person stands behind the content - which is more trustworthy than hiding AI involvement.
