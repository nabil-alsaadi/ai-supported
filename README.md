## The Mission

**AI** is not just a tool for automation; for many of us, it is an essential **accessibility bridge**. Whether for **Dyslexia**, **ADHD**, or other functional needs, **AI** unlocks capabilities that were previously out of reach.

The **AI Supported Badge** is a simple way to destigmatize this use. It signals to your readers:

> *"AI helped me draft this, but I reviewed it, verified it, and I take full responsibility for it."*
